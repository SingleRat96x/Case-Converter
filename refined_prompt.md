# Website Metadata Analysis Request

## Context
This is a multilingual website (English and Russian). However, when searching on Yandex Russia in Russian, search results display English metadata (title tag and meta description) instead of Russian.

## Request
**Please analyze the codebase and explain:**

1. **Why does Yandex show English metadata for Russian pages?**
   - What is the root cause of this issue?
   
2. **What metadata currently exists?**
   - Do we have Russian metadata defined anywhere?
   - Do we have English metadata defined anywhere?
   - Where are they located in the code?

3. **Simple explanation with example**
   - Explain the problem in simple terms
   - Use a concrete example from the codebase to illustrate

## Requirements
- ✅ **Analysis only** - Do NOT make any code changes yet
- ✅ **Facts only** - Base explanations strictly on what exists in the codebase
- ✅ **No assumptions** - If something is uncertain, state it clearly
- ✅ **Simple language** - Explain as if to someone learning about metadata
- ✅ **Show evidence** - Include relevant code snippets or file locations

## Expected Output Format

### Problem Summary
[Brief 2-3 sentence summary of the issue]

### Current Metadata Status
- **English metadata:** [Yes/No, where defined]
- **Russian metadata:** [Yes/No, where defined]

### Root Cause Analysis
